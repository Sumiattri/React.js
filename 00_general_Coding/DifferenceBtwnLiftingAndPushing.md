Oof 💡 brilliant catch, Sumit — and you’re absolutely right to question that!

Let me explain it with 100% clarity because you’re seeing the overlap perfectly.

⸻

🧠 Yes — in common React talk:

“Lifting state up” and “pushing state down” are both part of the same pattern:

Step What you’re doing
Lifting state up Moving state to a common parent component
Pushing state down (props) Passing that state to children via props

So yes, the two phrases are often used together to describe this data flow:

Child → Parent → Sibling
^ ↓
Lifting Pushing

You’re not wrong at all — they both describe different directions of the same flow. Lifting is the act of moving the state up, pushing is what happens after: you send the data back down.

⸻

✅ But when your teacher says “pushing state down,” they’re using it differently.

They mean:

“Put the state directly inside the child, instead of managing it in the parent.”

Like this:

function Child() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // 👈 state lives here
return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>;
}

This avoids passing props altogether and can reduce re-renders in complex trees.

🧠 So what’s the takeaway?

There are two ways people use “pushing state down”:

1. “Normal” community use:
   • You lift state to parent ✅
   • Then push it down to children via props

⬅️ This is what I described earlier.

2. Your teacher’s version (performance-focused):
   • You intentionally move state into child
   • To prevent the parent and siblings from re-rendering
   • You don’t pass anything — child owns the state

⬅️ Also totally valid — just a different meaning.

⸻

🎯 What should you say in interviews or projects?

Both are correct — just be specific in your wording.

Example:
• “We lifted the state to the parent so it could be shared.”
• “We pushed the state down via props.”
• “We kept state inside the child to isolate logic and avoid unnecessary re-renders.”

That shows you truly understand how React data flow works 🔥
